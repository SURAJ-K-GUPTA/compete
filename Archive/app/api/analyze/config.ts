   - Specify whether to add content before/after a reference text
   - Include the reference text in position.reference
3. For "replace" type:
   - Include both original and replacement text
   - Use precise start/end indices
4. For "delete" type:
   - Include only the original text
   - Use precise start/end indices
5. Keep reasoning concise and clear
6. Each suggestion must be self-contained and actionable`
